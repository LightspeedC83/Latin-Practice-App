# Latin Practice App

a program/application to help study the forms and meanings of Latin words. I hope to have it focus on commonly used words in the Aeneid and Caesar's DBG

## To do:
- ~~import list of first declension nouns~~
- ~~import list of second declension nouns~~
- ~~import list of second declension neuter nouns~~
- ~~import third declension nouns~~
- ~~investigate duplicates in third declension nouns (first culprit found was "hospes")~~
    - ~~(the solution doesn't fix the underlying problem, but sifts through the noun_list_third_combined.txt file and removes duplicates and puts everything into a new file because that seemed easier and I was feeling lazy)~~
- ~~import fourth declension nouns~~
- ~~import fifth declension nouns~~
- sift through third nouns to sort between neuter and third
- sift through the neuter nouns mixed in with the secon declension nouns
    - develop way of trying to automatically classify a noun based off principle parts
- update class system to reflect irregular second declension nouns (eg. "puer")
