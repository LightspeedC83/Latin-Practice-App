# Latin Practice App

a program/application to help study the forms and meanings of Latin words. I hope to have it focus on commonly used words in the Aeneid and Caesar's DBG

## To do:
- ~~import list of first declension nouns~~
- ~~import list of second declension nouns~~
- ~~import list of second declension neuter nouns~~
- sift through the neuter nouns mixed in with the secon declension nouns
    - develop way of trying to automatically classify a noun based off principle parts
- update class system to reflect irregular second declension nouns (eg. "puer")
